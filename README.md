# Graphics codebase

Computer graphics and visualization codebase made with python.

Goals:
- get more familiar with python
- implement graphics tasks from university


## Development

I use Nix for dependencies management, because it's quite easy.

You will need [Nix installed](nixos.org/download) to start developing with nix shell for this script.

After installation of Nix just run `nix-shell` in the root of the project.

To format code I use [Black](github.com/psf/black) formatter, run `black .` after you entered nix shell.
